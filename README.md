# First Steps in the MRI World - Lab

## Overview

This repository encompasses the results of practical activities related to Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) processing and an introduction to quantitative MRI (qMRI). It includes examples of DICOM image processing, manipulation of k-space, experimentation with quantitative MRI data, and analysis of noisy data. These materials aim to provide a comprehensive understanding of MRI image processing techniques and the fundamentals of qMRI.

- To explore the quantitative aspects of MRI and their implications in medical research.

## Usage

This repository is structured to facilitate learning through practical examples and exercises. Each section not only includes detailed explanations and introductions to the topics but also features a comprehensive Jupyter Notebook [MRI_trabajo.ipynb](MRI_trabajo.ipynb) with solved exercises. For an in-depth understanding of the results and methodologies employed, refer to the report [MRI_report Sevillano.pdf](MRI_report%20Sevillano.pdf), both of which are authored by me, ensuring authenticity and personal insight into the field of MRI image processing and qMRI.

Included in this repository are:
- Code examples in Python for processing and analyzing MRI data.
- The [MRI_trabajo.ipynb](MRI_trabajo.ipynb) notebook containing all exercises and solutions.
- A detailed report [MRI_report Sevillano.pdf](MRI_report%20Sevillano.pdf) elaborating on the exercises' outcomes and techniques used.
- Datasets and images to practice the demonstrated techniques.

All files necessary for the exercises, including datasets and images, are available within this repository, aiming to provide a comprehensive view on handling and understanding MRI data. The code and report are personally authored, reflecting my approach to exploring the capabilities and applications of MRI and qMRI in medical research.
